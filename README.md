"src" FOLDER:
- This folder contains the .py scripts to create the classifiers
-- logistic_regression.py creates the logistic regression classifier
-- nn_classifier.py creates the neural network classifier

"in" FOLDER:
- This is where the data used in the scripts should be placed. In this case however, no data needs to be provided.

"out" FOLDER:
- This is where classification reports will be saved as .txt files
